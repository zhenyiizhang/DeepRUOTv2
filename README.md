# DeepRUOTv2

This is the DeepRUOTv2 version of our previously published work DeepRUOT. We have improved the implementation of the original DeepRUOT version, offering a more user-friendly interface and establishing default parameters. We have computed results on more datasets in our latest work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11197): Mouse Blood Hematopoiesis (50D), Embryoid Body (50D), Pancreatic $\beta$ -cell differentiation (30D) and  A549 EMT (10D).


Results will be presented like this (Figure 3 in our [latest work]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11197))):
